# TripleTen-Projects

Below are projects I worked on while attending the Business Intelligence Analyst Bootcamp:

|1| E-Commerce Analytics | A project in Google Sheets to analyze sales data and communicate findings in a way that executives can understand easily.|
|2| Exploring Startup Trends | A project in SQL to further understand trends within a startup company, thus allowing us to analyze the data as a whole.|
|3| Case Study of Returned Items | A project that dove into why so many items were being returned at a department store that included a Tableau dashboard to further monitor returns.|
