They're specifically interested in dates where there was significant variation between the smallest and largest rounds. This indicates days when both very small and very large companies were receiving funding, which could signal unusual market activity. They also want to exclude days where some companies received no funding at all, as that skews the analysis.\n\nCreate a table showing the highest and lowest amount of money raised for each date in the `funding_round` table. Include the dates in your results. The resulting table should only have records where the lowest value is not equal to zero or to the highest value.\n\n{quiz-task}\npreset: |\n    default [default | red | orange | yellow | green | blue | purple]\ncontent: |\n    💡 **Relevant lessons**\n\n    This task combines grouping with filtering on aggregated data.

Funds that invest in many companies are often seen as having broader networks, while those with fewer investments might have deeper industry expertise. We need to categorize funds by their activity level to help our clients find appropriate partners.\n\nCreate a field with three categories:\n\n- `high_activity` — for funds that invest in a hundred or more companies\n- `middle_activity` — for funds that invest in between twenty (inclusive) to a hundred companies (exclusive)\n- `low_activity` — for funds that invest in fewer than twenty companies\n\nPrint all fields from the `fund` table and the new field with categories.\n\n{quiz-task}\npreset: |\n    default [default | red | orange | yellow | green | blue | purple]\ncontent: |\n    💡 **Relevant lessons**\n\n    This task introduces conditional logic in SQL.

Some argue that highly educated teams are more likely to succeed, while others claim education has little impact. To settle this debate with data, we need to compare the education levels of employees at successful companies versus those that closed after limited funding.\n\nWe'll start by identifying companies that closed after just one funding round, then analyze the educational backgrounds of their employees.\n\nFirst, make a list with the names of companies that closed down and had only one funding round while they existed.\n\nThen, find the employees who worked at these companies and join with the education table to analyze their degree types.\n\nFinally, calculate the average number of degrees per employee at these failed startups.\n\n{quiz-task}\npreset: |\n    default [default | red | orange | yellow | green | blue | purple]\ncontent: |\n    💡 **Relevant lessons**\n\n    This complex analysis requires subqueries and joins.
